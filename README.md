# Animation of an electromagnetic (EM) wave

A simple demonstration of how how electric (E) and magnetic (B) fields of a monochrome and linearly polarized EM wave behave.

It contains 2 files - one with the animation (EM_wave.py) and the other one (FancyArrowPatch3D.py) contains a modified FancyArrowPatch class (called FancyArrowPatch3D) which allows to plot arrows in 3d plots.
